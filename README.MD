# Requirements
- [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases)
- Optional: [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html)

# Usage
- Most common tasks can be done in the WPILib Command Palette in VS Code
- To build code: `gradle build`
- To deploy to robt: `gradle deploy`
- To install ShuffleBoard plugin and theme (`gradle :recharge-plugin:installPlugin :recharge-plugin:installTheme`)
  - Select the Cooper theme in ShuffleBoard preferences
  
### Galactic Search Vision
- To build: `gradle :galactic-search-vision:build` in root directory
- Execute `galactic-search-vision/build/image/bin/GalacticSearchVision`

# Structure
- `src`: Robot code
- `characterization`: FRC characterization robot projects and collected data
- `PathWeaver`: Currently used paths & generated trajectories
- `recharge-plugin`: Our custom Shuffleboard plugin
- `galactic-search-vision`: Our driver station computer vision program for Galactic Search

# Notes
- `recharge-vision` module is not in use. We're now using a Limelight instead for power port alignment.
